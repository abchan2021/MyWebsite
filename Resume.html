<p>I may not be the smartest, but I promise, I put my 100% effort into every single class. I believe being a well rounded person in and outside of school is the key to a successful life. I have experienced many different types of cultures and interacted with different people of the world on my journey. I believe I am ready for the real world more than I could have ever been. They say you can teach book smart but you can not teach street smart</p>
